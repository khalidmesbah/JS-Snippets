/* Types Of Scopes 
- global scope
- module scope
- function scope / local scope
- block scope
*/

/* where you can access a specific function or a variable in the call
- scope is defined by curly brackets
+ global scope
- Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope
- Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope.  
- Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters,
have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.
- It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name.
When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.
