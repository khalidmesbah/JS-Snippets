- objects provide very fast lookup time.
- Objects do not maintain an ordering to stored keys like arrays do; thus a key's position on an object, or the relative order in which it appears, is irrelevant when referencing or accessing that key.
- undefined == null => true
- undefined === null => false
- javascript objects are maps
- this === self === window === frames === globalThis
- + operates on strings & numbers so [1,2]+ [3,4] === 1,23,4 => if not a string | a number it tries to convert it to a string | number
